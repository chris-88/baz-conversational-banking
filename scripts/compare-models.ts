/**
 * Runs the same turns through several models and prints what each produced.
 *
 * The point is to make "has quality degraded?" answerable with evidence rather than a feeling.
 * Run it when changing BAZ_MODEL, and whenever a cheaper model starts looking suspect.
 *
 *   node --env-file=.env scripts/compare-models.ts
 *   node --env-file=.env scripts/compare-models.ts claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 claude-sonnet-5-5
 *
 * It calls the model directly with the real composed prompt — no database, so it writes
 * nothing and can be run against any case shape.
