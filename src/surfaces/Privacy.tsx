/**
 * What happens to what somebody types.
 *
 * Written to be true rather than to be safe. This is a prototype where real people type real
 * things — a name, a date of birth, what they earn — and the page it used to have said
 * "synthetic data only", which was about the bank's side of the ledger and read as though it
 * covered theirs.
 *
 * Linked from the notice card that appears the first time Baz records anything, and from the
 * landing page. Deliberately not in the chat header: the header is the wordmark and nothing
 * else, and a legal link up there would be the first thing a new customer reads.

          Baz is a working prototype, not a banking service. It is not operated by Bank of
          Ireland. Nothing you do here opens an account, applies for anything, or reaches a bank.
        </p>

        <Section title="What is kept">
          <p>
            Everything you type, and the conversation around it. Baz turns what you say into
            structured notes — your income, what you are saving for, who you are buying with —
            and keeps them so it does not have to ask twice. That is the thing being
            demonstrated.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>So what you type is real and it is stored.</strong> The bank side is
            invented: the customer records, balances and the sign-in are synthetic, and the
            product information is Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s own published material. Your side of
            the conversation is not synthetic, which is why this page exists.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please do not type anything you would mind being kept — a real PPS number, real
            account details, or anything about your health beyond what a form here explicitly
            asks for.
          </p>

        <Section title="Who sees it">
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-5">
            <li>
              <strong>Anthropic</strong> processes the conversation to generate replies.
              Messages are sent to their API, which is hosted in the United States.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Supabase</strong> stores the conversation and the notes, in their
              Ireland region.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sentry</strong> receives diagnostics when something breaks. It is sent a
              conversation id, whether you are a customer or a partner, and what the safety
              check decided — never message content and never any value Baz recorded.
            </li>
            <li>
              The people building this, through an operator console, to see whether it is
              working.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Cookies">
          <p>
            None for tracking, and no analytics or advertising of any kind. The site keeps your
            sign-in and a couple of interface preferences in your browser&rsquo;s own storage,
            which is what makes the conversation still be there when you come back.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Getting rid of it">
          <p>
            Ask and a conversation is deleted — all of it, including the notes taken from it.
            Conversations are also cleared regularly between demonstrations. Nothing here is
            kept for longer than the prototype needs it.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="If you sign in">
          <p>
            Signing in with Google or Apple tells us the email address and name on that account,
            so Baz can recognise you on another device and pick the conversation back up. That is
            all it is used for. It is not shared, and it does not connect to any real banking
            relationship.
