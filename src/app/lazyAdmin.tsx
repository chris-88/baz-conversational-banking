 * The console loads on demand; the customer never downloads it.

 * It is the larger half of this application — a charting library, a command palette, a data grid
 * — and none of it is reachable without typing `/admin`. Bundled together it arrived on every
 * phone that opened Baz, which is a cost paid by the people the product is for so that one
 * operator does not wait a moment.
 *
 * In its own file because `router.tsx` exports a router, and a module that exports both a
 * component and something else loses fast refresh.
