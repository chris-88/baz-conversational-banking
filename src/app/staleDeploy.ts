 * Recovering from a deploy that landed while the app was open.
 *
 * Every build hashes its filenames and GitHub Pages swaps the whole site at once, so the moment
 * a deploy finishes, the chunk names a running page knows are gone from the server. A page that
 * has been open across a deploy — a phone in a pocket, a tab left on a desk — asks for
 * `index-OLD.js` on its next navigation, gets a 404, and the import rejects.
 *
 * That page is not broken, it is stale, and a reload fetches the build that does exist. So we
 * reload. The guard is what makes that safe: if a reload does not fix it, the failure is
 * something else, and the customer gets an honest message instead of a tab that reloads forever.
