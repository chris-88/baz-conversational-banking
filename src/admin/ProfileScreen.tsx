/**
 * Who you are signed in as (§11).
 *
 * The spec asks for role and permissions, two-factor, sessions across devices, notification
 * preferences, timezone, language, theme and density. On a console with one operator, real
 * email auth and no notification system, most of that does not exist.
 *
 * So the rule here is that decorative must not mean untrue. A "Two-factor authentication —
 * Enabled" badge on an account with no second factor is a false claim about security, not a
 * placeholder. Everything on this screen is either real or visibly inert, and the inert controls
 * say what would have to be built rather than pretending to a state they are not in.
 *
 * Theme is the one that moved the other way: every dark token was already defined and nothing
 * applied `.dark`, so rather than a switch that lies it is a switch that works.
