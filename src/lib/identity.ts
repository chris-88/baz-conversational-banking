 * Signing in, so the conversation follows the person rather than the browser.
 *
 * Every visitor already has an anonymous Supabase user, and `participant_sessions` maps that
 * user to their participant on a case. The good path **attaches** an identity to the anonymous
 * user that is already there: `auth.uid()` does not change, so the case, the conversation, the
 * applications and every fact carry over with nothing to move and nothing to reconcile.
 *
 * It was once believed that was the only path, and it is not. Attaching fails whenever the
 * address already belongs to a user — a second device, or anybody signing in twice — and the
 * fall-through signs them into that account instead. Different
 * `auth.uid()`, no mapping, and a conversation that has disappeared at the precise moment it
 * was meant to be made safe. A live case was orphaned exactly this way.
 *
 * So both paths note who this browser was before they begin, and both claim the participant
 * afterwards. `participant_sessions` is many-to-one by design, which is the same fact wearing
 * a different hat: one person, several auth users, one conversation.
