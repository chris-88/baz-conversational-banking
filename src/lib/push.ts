 * Asking a browser to accept notifications, and telling the server where to send them.
 *
 * Three things have to be true before this can work, and they fail quietly and differently:
 * the browser must support the Push API, a service worker must be registered, and the person
 * must say yes. Each is reported separately rather than collapsed into false, because "this
 * phone cannot" and "they said no" need different things said to them.
 *
 * On iOS there is a fourth: Safari only offers push to a site that has been added to the Home
 * Screen. In a tab the API is simply absent, which is why `unsupported` carries a reason.
