/**
 * The way back, offered to the one person it applies to.
 *
 * Returning in the same browser works by itself: the anonymous user is in storage and
 * `participant_sessions` maps it to the conversation. Three other returns do not — storage
 * cleared, a different device, and Safari against an installed app, which are separate storage
 * on the same phone — and all three produce an empty new conversation with no sign that
 * anything else exists. The menu holds the way back for them, but nobody looks in a menu for a
 * thing they do not know is there.
 *
 * So it is offered on the opening screen, and only where there is evidence it means something:
 * an address this browser has signed in with before, and nobody signed in now. A first-time
 * visitor sees nothing, which is the point — the opening screen asks one question and waits,
 * and a sign-in on it would be the login wall this product is trying not to be.
 *
 * It cannot help somebody whose browser has never signed in here. Nothing can, short of asking
 * every arrival for an address, and that trade is not worth making.
