 * What Baz said, with the little markdown it actually uses.
 *
 * Bold and bullets, and nothing else. The model reaches for `**label:**` and `- ` when it is
 * listing what changed since somebody was last here — which is the one turn the prompt asks
 * for a list — and the transcript was printing the asterisks.
 *
 * Hand-written rather than a markdown library for two reasons. The surface is two constructs,
 * so a parser that also does tables, images and raw HTML is a lot of behaviour to accept for
 * them. And it builds React nodes rather than HTML, so there is no sanitiser to get wrong:
 * text from the model can only ever become text.
