/**
 * Baz's mark at a fixed size, for headers and nameplates.
 *
 * It used to draw its own face — a white robot on a blue disc, from the original asset pack —
 * which meant the product had two marks: that one in every header, and the mark from the
 * opening-transition spec in the conversation itself. The whole point of that spec is that the
 * thing waiting in the middle of the screen becomes the thing talking to you, which does not
 * survive a different logo sitting above it.
 *
 * So this is now the same component the chat uses, sized. The app icon is the one place that
 * still carries its own copy, because an icon has no page to inherit a colour from
 * (`public/favicon.svg`).
