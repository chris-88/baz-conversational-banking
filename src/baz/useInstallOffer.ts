 * home screen is the natural next sentence. Not on arrival, which would be a wall; not inside
 * the installed app, which would be absurd; and not twice on one device.
 *
 * Once per device rather than once per case, because installing is a property of the device.
 * The same case on a laptop should not have used up the phone's one offer.
