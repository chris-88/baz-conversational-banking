 * The two ways forward after the customer has chosen an option to go through.
 *
 * Baz asks this in words — these only save the typing. They are the two things somebody actually
 * wants at that moment, and neither of them is "tell me your income": a person who has just
 * picked a four-year fixed to look at more closely is still looking at it.
 *
 * Fixed rather than generated, because they are a fork in the conversation rather than a
 * decision about anything. Nothing is committed by tapping one.
