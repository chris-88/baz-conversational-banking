/**
 * A card becoming what happened to it.
 *
 * The offer and its outcome used to swap in a single render, both when the tap landed and when
 * the conversation was opened again later. Now they cross-fade, and the same component does it
 * on both paths, so a card looks the same the instant it settles and a day afterwards.
 *
 * Opacity only, with the outgoing card finishing before the incoming one starts. A height
 * animation would be nicer and is not allowed: it triggers layout, and the first motion rule is
 * that nothing here does. Under reduced motion there is no cross-fade, just the outcome.
