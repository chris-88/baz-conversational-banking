 * A `contenteditable` rather than a textarea, for one reason: iOS puts a previous/next/Done
 * strip above the keyboard whenever a real form control has focus, and it does not do that for
 * an editable region. That strip is about fifty pixels of system chrome sitting between the
 * conversation and the keys, and on a phone that is the most expensive space on the screen.
 *
 * It costs the things a native field gives away — paste arrives as HTML and has to be flattened,
 * the accessible name has to be declared rather than inferred — and buys back the growth logic,
 * since an editable region is already the size of its content.
 *
 * Enter sends, shift-enter breaks the line, which is the convention everywhere this is modelled
 * on and the one thing it would be annoying to get wrong.
