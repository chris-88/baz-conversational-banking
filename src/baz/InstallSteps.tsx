/**
 * The two taps that put Baz on an iPhone's home screen.
 *
 * In one place because it is wanted in three: the card that offers the home screen after
 * signing in, and the two spots where somebody asks for notifications in Safari and cannot
 * have them until the app is installed. That last case used to get a sentence saying so,
 * which is an instruction with no instruction. The person has just said what they want, and
 * the only thing between them and it is two taps we already know how to show.
 *
 * iOS only. There is no install API there; the Share sheet is the route, and the glyph
 * breathes so the eye finds the one it is about to look for on the toolbar.
