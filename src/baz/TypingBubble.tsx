 * somewhere else on the screen. Opacity only — the spec rules out vertical bouncing, and it is
 * right: three dots hopping reads as a toy, three dots breathing reads as someone thinking.
 *
 * Nothing is announced from here. A node that unmounts the moment the answer begins is the
 * wrong place for a live region, so the announcement lives in a stable one in `BazChat`.
