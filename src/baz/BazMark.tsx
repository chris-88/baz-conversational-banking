/**
 * Baz's icon, from `docs/baz-icon.svg`.
 *
 * A lowercase `b` — a stem and a ring for its bowl — with two eyes inside the bowl. It is the
 * same letter that opens the wordmark, which is the point: the thing in the middle of the
 * opening screen and the first letter of the name are one object.
 *
 * Drawn here rather than imported as a file so it can take a colour. The artwork is a single
 * blue; `currentColor` is what lets the same component sit in the brand blue, in a muted
 * header, and on a dark ground without a second asset.
 *
 * Not square — 64 by 72, because the stem rises above the bowl. `preserveAspectRatio` keeps it
 * honest inside a square slot rather than stretching the ring into an oval.
