-- A current account in one name is a product Baz can start (§7).
--
-- The joint account was built first because it is the one that demonstrates invitation and
-- partner completion, which left somebody banking on their own being told the only current
-- account on offer was a joint one — a gap in the catalogue reading as a gap in the bank.
--
-- The check constraints are what keep the database and the TypeScript union honest with each
-- other, so both move together. `tests/schema-drift.test.ts` fails if they drift.
