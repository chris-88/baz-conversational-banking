-- An application against a real digital form definition.
--
-- Distinct from `applications`, which tracks a product journey through Baz's own state machine.
-- This is narrower and more literal: the answers collected for one form, keyed by that form's
-- own field ids, so the packet the existing web journey would POST can be built from them at
-- any moment.
--
-- Answers live in one jsonb column rather than a row per answer. They are only ever read and
-- written as a set, the form's field ids are the keys and the definition is the schema, so a
-- table of key-value rows would add joins and a second place for the shape to drift.
--
-- Deliberately inspectable while incomplete. The console must be able to open an application
-- nobody has finished and show what has been collected so far beside the packet it maps to,
-- which is how the mapping is demonstrated rather than asserted.
