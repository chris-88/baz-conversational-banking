-- Editing the catalogue's wording without pretending its conditions are editable (plan §3.2).

-- A goal's signals are predicates over facts. No form edits those, and putting the sharpest part
-- of the system behind one would buy nothing and risk a new class of runtime failure. What a
-- presenter does want to change between run-throughs is the prose, so the prose lives here and
-- overlays the compiled catalogue. `domain/catalogue/overlay.ts` applies it.

-- `enabled` is the single field that changes behaviour, and it is a switch rather than a rule,
-- so it cannot be malformed. Everything else changes only what Baz says.
