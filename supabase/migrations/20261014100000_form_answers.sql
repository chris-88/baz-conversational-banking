-- Answers given to a digital form that are not Baz facts.
--
-- Most of what a form wants is something Baz already holds, or should: a name, an income, an
-- address. Those live in `facts` and are mapped into whatever form needs them, which is what
-- makes the same answer serve every product.
--
-- The rest is form-specific and belongs to the form. "Do you use 365 online?" is not a fact
-- about a person worth carrying between products. Neither is a declaration whose wording is
-- particular to one lending application. Those are recorded here, against the form application
-- they were given for, and they never pretend to be anything more general than that.
--
-- Consent is the reason this table carries wording and a participant. A confirmation is only
-- meaningful if there is a record of exactly what was agreed, by whom and when, and a checkbox
-- value of "Yes" with no wording beside it is not evidence of anything (§10 of the feature
-- note, Invariant 6).
