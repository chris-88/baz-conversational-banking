-- Feedback, collaborators and where arrivals came from (§44, §53).
--
-- Feedback is given from the conversation: a thumbs on one of Baz's replies, or a rating and
-- some words about the whole thing from the menu. It is kept against the case and, for a
-- thumbs, the message, so the console shows it beside the turn it was about. A collaborator
-- is somebody who asked to be contacted about working on this, written from the public site
-- by an anonymous visitor with a daily cap in front of it. A case's source is the entry point
-- it arrived through (a QR code, a poster, a link), for the funnel after a show and tell.
