 * one is parsed on first use, so a hand-edited JSON file fails the turn that loads it with a
 * Zod message rather than producing a strange conversation.
 *
 * Scripts are transcribed from real conversations, turn for turn, so what they replay is what
 * the model actually did on a live case and not an idea of it.
