/**
 * A combination is a claim about two products at once, so both halves have to be true.
 *
 * The one here was prompted by a banker's instinct — MortgageSaver for the balance, SuperSaver
 * for the monthly, rotate after a year — and checking it against the pack changed it: a lump
 * sum in MortgageSaver earns the "other balance" rate of 0.5%, not the 2% headline, which only
 * applies to monthly contributions. The arrangement is still right; the reason is the €2,000
 * bonus rather than the rate.
