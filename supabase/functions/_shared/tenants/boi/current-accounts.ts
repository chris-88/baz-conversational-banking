/**
 * Which of Bank of Ireland's current accounts to put in front of somebody.
 *
 * The journey knows an application is `current_account`. The pack holds five accounts an adult
 * can open in their own name, and what separates them is eligibility and a fee: the Personal
 * account has a monthly fee and the other four have none, each for a reason the pack states.
 * Left to the model, the Personal account was offered to everybody, because it is the one the
 * public site leads with, so a graduate starting a first job was shown the account with the fee
 * rather than the one built for them. The pick is made here, from facts, and the model explains
 * it: the same split as everywhere else (Invariant 3, §51).
 *
 * Tenant-side on purpose. These are Bank of Ireland's own eligibility lines, and the domain does
 * not know this bank has a Golden Years account (Invariant 11).
 *
 * Nothing in `because` is a figure of this file's own. The fee and the eligibility wording are
 * read out of the product each time, so an edited catalogue is explained from what it now says,
 * and an account a presenter has switched off is never picked.
