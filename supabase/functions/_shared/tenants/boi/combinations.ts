/**
 * How products work together, which no product page says.
 *
 * A catalogue lists things one at a time. A banker sitting across a desk knows that two of them
 * used together beat either alone, and that is the knowledge a customer cannot get from a
 * website — so it is exactly what Baz is for.
 *
 * Facts only. Each of these states what is true of the products and what it costs or earns, and
 * leaves the choosing to the customer: the pack's own rules forbid calling anything "best"
 * without an authorised basis, and a combination is still a recommendation if it is phrased as
 * one. "People saving a deposit often do this, and here is the arithmetic" is not.
 *
 * Every figure here is read from the same snapshots as the rest of the catalogue, so the same
 * caution applies: they move, and the live ones are on the product pages.
