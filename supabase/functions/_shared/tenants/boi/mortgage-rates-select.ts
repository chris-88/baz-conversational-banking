/**
 * Picking the rates to put in front of somebody.
 *
 * A published rate is a function of four things at once — who the customer is, the property's
 * BER, the term, and how much they are borrowing — and 133 rows is far too many to hand a model
 * and hope. So the model gathers the four answers and this decides which rows they entitle
 * somebody to. The model never reads the table (Invariant 3).
 *
 * The comparison it builds is the one the supplied pack asks for by name: a High Value Mortgage
 * carries the lowest headline rate and no cashback, so putting it beside a cashback rate and
 * calling the lower number better is exactly the mistake to avoid. Both go on the card with
 * their actual figures, and Baz does the explaining.
