/**
 * The catalogue against itself.
 *
 * A product with variants has its rates in two places the moment somebody writes one into
 * `illustrativeTerms` as well, and the two drift silently: the mortgage advertised "3.85% for 3
 * years" in prose while the card offered 3.1%, 3.3%, 3.4% and 3.9%. Baz read both, quoted the
 * prose, and told the customer to go by the card — looking wrong because the data was.
