/**
 * Bank of Ireland's savings accounts, in the shape the arrangement engine needs.
 *
 * The engine is portable and knows nothing about this bank (Invariant 11), so the limits and
 * rates it reasons about have to be handed to it. Everything here is read out of the pack
 * rather than restated: the pack states pricing in a different shape for almost every family,
 * and the translation is the whole job of this file.
 *
 * What cannot be read is declared here with a reason. The pack puts "€200–€2,500 monthly DD"
 * and "Min €5,000" in prose feature lists, because they are written for a person reading a
 * product page rather than for something allocating money across three of them.
