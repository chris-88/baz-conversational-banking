/**
 * What Bank of Ireland publishes about switching a mortgage to it.
 *
 * Read from the switcher page, the Cashback Plus page, the documentation checklist and the
 * Mortgage Switcher Guide brochure (37-1385R.15, 07/26) on 2026-10-20. None of it is invented
 * and none of it is a rate: rates come from the rate table. This is the process, the costs, the
 * limits and the documents, so Baz can say what a switch involves rather than "right here, no
 * forms" (case eb37e9b5).
 *
 * Tenant data, injected (Invariant 11). The domain's `compareSwitch` takes the costs as an
 * argument; the prompt section is composed from these lines.
