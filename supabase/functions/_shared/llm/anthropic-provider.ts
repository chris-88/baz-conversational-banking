/**
 * The real model, behind the seam.
 *
 * A pass-through with two narrowings: only text deltas are yielded, because that is all the
 * loop reads, and the final message's usage is mapped into the cost model's shape. The request
 * object goes to the SDK exactly as built, so caching breakpoints and tool schemas are
 * untouched by this layer.
 *
 * Errors are not caught here. An SDK error thrown during iteration propagates through the
 * generator unchanged, and that matters: the turn's own error handling reads the message to
 * tell a spend limit apart from a timeout, and it needs the SDK's words to do it.
