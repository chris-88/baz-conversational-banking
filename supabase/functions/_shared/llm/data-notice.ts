/**
 * The data-protection notice, as a card.
 *
 * Fixed copy, built here, shown by the server the first time a fact is written for a case. Not
 * a tool, so the model cannot summon it, skip it, paraphrase it or argue with somebody about
 * it — which is the whole reason it is not a tool.
 *
 * Timing is the point. At the start of a conversation it is a wall of text before anybody has
 * said anything, which the opening screen deliberately avoids; at the end it is too late. The
 * moment Baz first writes something down is when it becomes true and when it is worth reading.
