/**
 * The model, as a Baz turn needs it and no wider.
 *
 * `runBazTurn` used to take an `Anthropic` client and call `messages.stream` on it, which
 * meant the only way to run a turn was to pay for one. CLAUDE.md said for weeks that a fixture
 * provider was "the single change that would most improve what the suite can catch", and it
 * was right: the output-ceiling bug, the data-notice bug and the product-collapse bug all
 * reached a person before a test, because no test could drive a conversation.
 *
 * So this is the seam. It is exactly the shape the loop reads and nothing more: one request
 * shape, one streamed event, one final message. The Anthropic adapter is a few lines that pass
 * things through; the fixture replays a script. Neither knows about the other.
 *
 * Deliberately not a general LLM abstraction. There is one provider and one fixture, and a
 * second provider would be a decision, not a drop-in.
