/**
 * The shape of a conversation, declared in one place.
 *
 * This is the file to edit to change how Baz runs a conversation. Each stage says what it is
 * for, what to do in it, and what is explicitly not yet. `stageFor` decides which one applies
 * from the case; this decides what happens in it.
 *
 * It is here rather than spread through the prompt because the arc kept getting lost. Guidance
 * about discovery sat in one section, guidance about offering in another, and the model had to
 * infer an order that nobody had written down. A transcript could therefore run eight questions
 * deep and arrive at a product card having never named a goal, never proposed a plan and never
 * once asked the customer which of those they wanted.
 *
 * `tools` is enforcement, not advice. A stage's list is the list the turn is offered, so a
 * product card cannot appear while a conversation is still working out what somebody wants,
 * however reasonable it would seem in the moment.
