    // CLAUDE.md lists seven. `show_form` is the eighth, added for §7.5: health data cannot be
    // collected in conversation, so there has to be a way to surface the form. It still only
    // shows — the server decides which form is due, and the customer's tap is what commits.
    //
    // `propose_plan` is the ninth and the only one not named show_/record_/request_, so it is
    // worth being explicit: it writes a DRAFT plan nobody is held to. The plan becomes the
    // customer's when they tap the card, which calls case-action like every other commitment.
    // Proposing is not acting.
    //
    // `show_quote` is the tenth and computes nothing itself: it passes what the customer said
    // to the quote engine, which does the arithmetic from the catalogue. Choosing an option on
    // the card starts nothing either — it asks Baz to go through that one.
    //
    // `show_comparison` is the eleventh and passes only catalogue ids. Everything shown beside
    // each product is read from the knowledge base by the server, so the model chooses what to
    // compare and cannot describe a product into existence. Tapping one starts nothing.
    //
    // `show_mortgage_rates` is the twelfth and is the most tempting one to get wrong, because
    // quoting a rate feels like an act. It passes four answers the customer gave — buyer type,
    // BER, amount, term — and the server decides which of 133 published rows they are entitled
    // to see and what the repayments are. The model never reads the table, cannot show a rate
    // below its minimum, and cannot price a BER the bank has not published. The card is not
    // tappable at all: a published rate is not an offer, and nothing should start from one.
    //
    // `record_form_answers` is the thirteenth and belongs to the digital forms feature. It is
    // the same kind of thing as `record_facts`: what the customer just said, checked by the
    // server against the bank's published definition before it is written. It refuses a
    // declaration and refuses an upload, whatever it is sent, because those need a tap and a
    // file. It cannot submit anything.
    //
    // `show_form_declarations` is the fourteenth and is the one that could look like acting,
    // because consent is the thing a model must never manufacture. It takes an application id
    // and nothing else: the wording comes out of the published definition, the server builds
    // the card, and the customer ticking each line and tapping is what records any of it.
    //
    // `show_form_upload` is the fifteenth and takes an application id for the same reason: the
    // server picks which document the form is waiting for and reads the accepted types and
    // size cap out of the published control. A file arrives through `upload`, not through
    // this, and what reaches the packet is a reference with the production signature fields
    // left empty.
    //
    // `show_arrangement` is the sixteenth and takes nothing at all. The server reads the facts
    // it holds and the published rates and works the split out; the model cannot pass a figure
    // because there is no figure it could pass that it did not make up. One tap on the card
    // starts every account on it, through `select_products` like any other start.
