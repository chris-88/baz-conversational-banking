 * The goal section tells the model what gates the plan card, not only what is unknown.
 *
 * Case ad93c361: the customer asked for a plan three times while three facts were missing, the
 * stage withheld `propose_plan` as designed, and the model, unable to see the gate, drew the
 * empty status card as the plan and said it was done. These pin the sentence that closes that
 * gap, on both sides of the threshold.
