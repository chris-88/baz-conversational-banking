 * push notification brings them back for, opens with this card before the model has said a
 * word: the account's name, its number, where the debit card is going and what to do next.
 * Every word is read from the case. The model is not asked for any of it and has no tool that
 * shows it, because an account number the model wrote would be an account number the model
 * made up (Invariant 2).
 *
 * Owed once to each opened account. Which ones have been welcomed is read from the transcript
 * by application id rather than counted in the loaded messages: those are a window sized for
 * the model, and a welcome counted only there came back every time it scrolled out of them,
 * while a count could not tell two opened accounts apart and would have welcomed the newer one
 * twice and the older never.
