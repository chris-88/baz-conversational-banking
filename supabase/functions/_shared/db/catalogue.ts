/**
 * The catalogue and the rate table as Baz should use them this turn (§51).
 *
 * Rows in the database when there are any, the compiled files when there are none. The
 * compiled files are the published set, read from the bank's site on a date; the rows are what
 * a presenter has loaded and edited since. Each row is re-validated on the way out, so a row
 * that somehow stopped matching its schema is skipped with a note in the logs rather than
 * handed to the prompt or to `selectRates`.
 *
 * One query each, at the start of a turn, on the service role. The result goes into the cached
 * prompt prefix, which stays byte-identical turn to turn as long as the rows do, so caching is
 * unaffected until somebody edits something, and then it rewrites once.
