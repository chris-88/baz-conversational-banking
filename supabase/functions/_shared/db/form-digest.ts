/**
 * What the bank's own form still wants, in words Baz can ask.
 *
 * This is the half of the feature a packet cannot show. The engine works out which of 418
 * controls apply to this customer and which are already answered from what Baz holds; the
 * model's job is to ask for what is left, in a sentence rather than a field label, and in an
 * order that sounds like a conversation rather than a form, and then to record each answer
 * against the id it was listed with.
 *
 * Deliberately short. A digest listing forty remaining questions would cost real money on every
 * turn and would invite the model to ask them all at once, which is the interrogation this
 * whole product exists to replace. A handful at a time is also how a person would do it.
