/**
 * Answers to the form's own questions, as given in conversation.
 *
 * The counterpart to `recordFacts`, and checked as hard. The model is told what the form wants
 * and in what terms; what it sends back is verified against the published document before any
 * of it is written, because a form answer that the platform would reject, or that silently
 * lands on a field nobody asked about, is worse than no answer at all.
 *
 * Which field an answer is for is settled first, by id and then by label. The digest lists
 * every question with its id in brackets and tells the model to copy it; for two days it
 * listed labels alone, the model guessed ids, and every answer was refused with "no such
 * field". The id is still the key. A label is accepted when exactly one live question carries
 * it, because SuperSaver asks "Are you a US citizen?" once per applicant and a guess between
 * the two would put an answer on the wrong person. A refusal names the ids that would have
 * worked, so the next round can be right rather than another guess.
 *
 * Four refusals after that, in order of how badly they would end:
 *
 *   - a declaration or an upload, which need a tap and a file and can never come from chat
 *   - a field this customer's branch does not reach
 *   - something the form works out for itself
 *   - a value a choice field does not offer
 *
 * Refusals come back to the model as reasons, the way fact refusals do, so a turn where
 * everything bounced is visible rather than looking like a turn where nothing was tried.
