/**
 * What Baz is allowed to know while it is talking to the partner (§33, Invariant 7).
 *
 * Built by selection, never by subtraction. It starts from nothing and adds only what belongs
 * to this participant, so a field added to the case later cannot leak by being forgotten
 * about here. Taking the primary's digest and removing the private parts is the obvious
 * alternative and it is one missed property away from telling somebody what their partner
 * earns.
 *
 * What a partner may see:
 *
 *   - facts whose subject is them, and household facts, which are theirs by definition
 *   - the names and states of applications their journey actually involves them in
 *   - what is outstanding *from them*
 *
 * Everything else is absent and stays absent: the primary's facts, the primary's conversation,
 * product interests, declined products, advisories, plans, goals, needs, check-ins. Some of
 * those would be harmless. They are left out anyway, because the rule that survives a year of
 * changes is "nothing unless it is theirs" rather than a list of exceptions somebody has to
 * remember to extend.
