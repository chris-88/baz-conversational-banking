   * it, and the person was standing in a new account looking at an empty screen.
   *
   * So the browser says who it was, and the server moves the participant onto who it is now.

   * Which conversation then *opens* is a separate question, decided by `landingFor`: somebody
   * signing in is reaching for a conversation they already had, so the account's own wins over
   * the empty one they created by arriving. The arriving one is still attached when it has
   * anything in it, so it is in the switcher rather than gone.
