/**
 * What a switch is worth, over the period the customer can actually compare.
 *
 * Case eb37e9b5: a customer with €300,000 over twenty years, offered 4% to stay, asked three
 * times to have that set against the bank's two-year fixed with €6,000 cashback, and was told
 * each time to take the repayments and subtract the cashback himself. The arithmetic is not
 * the model's to do and it is not the customer's either.
 *
 * The comparison runs over the candidate's fixed period, because that is the only period on
 * which either rate is known. A whole-term figure would be inventing the other eighteen years.
 * Costs are listed beside the result and never subtracted from it: the published ones are
 * ranges and "agreed with your solicitor", and a net figure built on a guess would be the
 * plausible number this whole codebase exists to avoid.
