/**
 * Editing the catalogue without pretending the conditions are editable.
 *
 * A goal's signals are predicates over facts — `savings < essentials * 3` — and no form edits
 * that. What a presenter actually wants to change between run-throughs is the wording: a name
 * that reads badly in the room, a description that over-promises, a check-in agenda that misses
 * the point. So that moves to a database row that overlays the compiled catalogue, and the
 * conditions stay in code where they are tested (plan §3.2, decision 2).
 *
 * The split is the whole design. Anything here changes what Baz *says*. Only `enabled` changes
 * what Baz *does*, and that is a switch rather than a rule, so it cannot be malformed.
