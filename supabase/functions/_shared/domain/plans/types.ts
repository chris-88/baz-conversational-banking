 * Customer Plans — where the customer is trying to get to, and how far along they are.

 * adds trajectory: the thing that makes a mortgage, a joint account, a savings account and a
 * deferred loan one objective rather than five unrelated applications.
 *
 * What is stored and what is computed is the whole design. A plan holds decisions — the goal,
 * the target the customer agreed, when a milestone was actually reached, when the next
 * check-in is due. Everything else is derived from the case on demand: progress, the gap, the
 * projected date, whether it is on track. A stored percentage is a number that can disagree
 * with the balance it came from, and this codebase already has three engines that refuse to
 * do that (Invariant 2, Invariant 3).
