/**
 * An IBAN that reads as one and belongs to nobody.
 *
 * The welcome card shows an account number, because an account without one is not open in any
 * sense a customer recognises. A real bank code with an invented account number is the wrong
 * way to get one: Irish account numbers are eight digits, and eight invented digits behind a
 * real bank's code are somebody's account often enough to matter (Invariant 10). So the bank
 * code is `BAZZ`, which no institution is registered under, the sort code is one no branch has,
 * and the BIC says the same thing in its own alphabet.
 *
 * The check digits are real. ISO 7064 mod 97-10 is what any form validates an IBAN with, and a
 * number that failed it would be refused by the first thing it was pasted into, which is not
 * the demonstration anybody wants.
 *
 * Pure, and deterministic in the application id, so the same account shows the same number on
 * every turn without anything being stored.
