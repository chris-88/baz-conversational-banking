/**
 * What applying for something would involve, before anybody has applied (§8, §53).
 *
 * A customer who has just been shown what a mortgage costs will ask what applying takes. Until
 * now the digest had no answer: `outstanding` is computed for applications that exist, so for a
 * product merely being discussed the model had nothing to work from and would have improvised
 * the requirements of an Irish mortgage from whatever it happened to know. Inventing a bank's
 * paperwork is the same class of mistake as inventing its rates (§51).
 *
 * So the same requirement engine runs against a hypothetical: the real journey, the facts the
 * case already holds, and no application. What comes back is honest in both directions — what
 * would be needed, and what would not be asked for again, which is the reuse story (§53) told
 * before an application exists rather than after.

 * `known` covers everything the case can already answer — including what needs a tick at review
