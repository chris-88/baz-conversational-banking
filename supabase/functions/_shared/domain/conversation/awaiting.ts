/**
 * The card still waiting for the customer, read from the transcript and the case.
 *
 * "A card is the question" covers the turn a card is shown on. Nothing covered the turn after
 * it. Baz put a joint current account on screen, the customer wrote "Great" instead of tapping
 * it, and Baz took the word for the tap: it asked the account's discovery questions, said it
 * had everything it needed for an application that did not exist, and only twelve minutes
 * later, asked how the partner joins, noticed that nothing had been started and showed the
 * card again.
 *
 * So the turn is told, from the case, that a card is waiting. Which card and how far back come
 * from the persisted messages; whether it has been answered comes from what the case now
 * holds, the same way the client decides whether a card keeps its buttons
 * (`src/baz/cardState.ts`). Never from the model, which is the thing that got it wrong.
 *
 * Only a card's type is saved with its message, not its payload (`db/rows.ts`), and the case
 * carries no creation times for applications, plans or interests. So the rules here cannot ask
 * "did an application for one of these options appear after this card". What the transcript
 * does carry is every tap that committed something: the app reports a tap to Baz as an action
 * turn, and the report is saved as a `system` message. A `system` message after the card is
 * the customer doing something in the app after it went up, and the case corroborates that per
 * type where it can.
 *
 * Where it cannot, the rules err towards settled. A card reported as waiting when it was in
 * fact tapped would have Baz pointing at a decision the case already shows made, which is the
 * mirror image of the fault this exists to fix; a card missed is only the old behaviour.
