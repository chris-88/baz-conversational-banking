/**
 * Where a conversation has got to, computed rather than sensed.
 *
 * Everything else in this product follows one rule: the engine decides what is true and the
 * model decides how to say it. The conversation itself was the exception. Nothing knew whether
 * a customer had been understood yet, so nothing could say "not products, not yet", and a
 * transcript could run eight questions deep and then produce a product card with no goal, no
 * plan and no moment where anybody was asked what they actually wanted.
 *
 * So the arc is a state machine like any other. The stage is derived from the case, the
 * guidance for each stage is declared in one file, and the tools a turn is offered are the
 * tools that stage allows. A stage is never chosen by the model and never stored: it is read
 * off the case every turn, which means correcting a fact or changing their mind moves the
 * conversation back by itself.
