/**
 * What else a turn is doing, besides the card it put on screen.
 *
 * A card that waits for a tap is the question of that turn. Baz was showing a comparison of two
 * savings accounts and, underneath it, asking what the customer paid in rent and whether they
 * banked jointly — three demands in one breath, and whichever the customer answered, the others
 * were left hanging. The card is also the thing that gets scrolled past when there is text under
 * it to reply to.
 *
 * The rule is declared in the stage guides and in the tool descriptions, where the model reads
 * it at the point of deciding. This is the other half: a deterministic check that says whether
 * it was followed, so that breaking it leaves a row behind rather than only a screenshot. It
 * cannot unsay the words — they are already streamed — but it can stop being invisible, which
 * is the same bargain `card_promised_not_shown` makes.
 */

/**
 * Whether this reply asks the customer something.
 *
 * Punctuation is not enough on its own. The turn that prompted all of this was written once
 * without a question mark at the end and read exactly the same way, so an interrogative opening
 * counts whether or not anybody closed it properly.
