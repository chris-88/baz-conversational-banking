 * What the bank asks for after an application has gone in (§41).

 * its assessors can ask for more, and that ask is not in any journey file: it is a row in
 * `application_requests` whose requirement id no journey knows. The console simulates one;
 * this is what turns it into something the requirement engine, the status card and
 * `request_upload` can all see, so the customer is told what is wanted and has somewhere to
 * send it. Before this, Baz read the event, said "the team asked for one more payslip",
 * offered the upload, and the handler answered that nothing was outstanding.
