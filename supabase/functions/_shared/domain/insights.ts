/**
 * What the numbers on the analytics screen add up to (§9, the insights panel).
 *
 * Deterministic rules over counts, in the same spirit as `advisories.ts`: no model, no judgement,
 * nothing that cannot be checked against the figures beside it. An insight here is a restatement
 * of what is already on screen — "five goals discovered, none became an application" — not an
 * inference about why.
 *
 * That restriction is the point. A panel that speculates is a panel somebody has to fact-check,
 * and a console whose headline claim is that the engine is deterministic cannot have one corner
 * of it guessing.
