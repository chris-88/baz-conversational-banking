 * the person is carrying in their head.
 *
 * So signing in is the mechanism, and these are the two decisions it needs made for it:
 * whether the conversation they are standing in is worth bringing with them, and which of the
 * two conversations they then end up with should be the one on screen. Both are decided here,
 * from counts, rather than in the function that happens to be holding the request.
