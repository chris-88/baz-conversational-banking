/**
 * The Goal Engine — where the customer is trying to get to.
 *
 * Banking organises customers around products. Needs added intent: what is required. A goal
 * adds destination, which is what makes a mortgage, a joint account, a savings account and a
 * deferred loan one objective rather than five unrelated applications.
 *
 *     Life circumstance → Goal → Milestones → Needs → Actions → Products → Applications
 *
 * Three rules shape everything here.
 *
 * A blueprint is not a plan (§18). The catalogue holds reusable definitions; a customer's plan
 * is a separate stored object that references one. Nothing customer-specific belongs in this
 * folder.
 *
 * Discovery is not activation (§6). The engine may be certain a goal applies and still have no
 * business creating a plan — that needs the customer to say yes, which is an event, not an
 * inference (Invariant 1).
 *
 * Signals are conditions, not phrases (§5). The catalogue document describes signals as things
 * a customer might say; matching those strings would make this a keyword engine. Extraction
 * turns language into facts, and this turns facts into goals.
