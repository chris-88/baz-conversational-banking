/**
 * The form's decision machinery: quotes, affordability and the eligibility verdict.
 *
 * The loan definition does not only describe questions. It describes four custom controls that
 * calculate, and one of them decides whether an application can proceed at all. That is what
 * makes this form a stronger proof than SuperSaver, and also what makes it the most dangerous
 * part to implement: a conversational assistant that invents an eligibility result is not a
 * demonstration of anything anybody would ship.
 *
 * So every control declares how honest it is, in its own output, and the console shows it:
 *
 *   source_faithful  computed here, from the definition's own declared inputs
 *   fixture          a stand-in, labelled as one, with the real contract unknown
 *   unsupported      the journey cannot proceed through this control
 *
 * The parameters are source-faithful for all of them, because the definition declares them:
 * field 238 carries `loanAmount: "{:255}"`, `salaryNet: "{:83}+{:91}"` and ten more. Those are
 * the bank's own references into its own form, resolved against this customer's answers.
 *
 * The results divide. A repayment is standard amortisation and is computed. An eligibility
 * verdict is undisclosed underwriting and is not: it is a fixture, it says so, and the model
 * has no way to set it.
