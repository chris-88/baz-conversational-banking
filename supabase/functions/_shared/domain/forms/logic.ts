 * Which questions apply to this customer, decided in code.

 * The SuperSaver definition carries 540 rules across 246 of its 499 fields. A model asked to
 * work out which apply would be wrong occasionally and unaccountably, and the consequence is
 * not cosmetic: a required field that is not active must not block the journey, and a field
 * that is active must not be skipped. Same division as everywhere else in Baz, the engine
 * decides what is needed and the model decides how to ask.
 *
 * The operator surface is `is`, `isnot`, `>` and `<`, with `all` or `any`, acting to `show` or
 * `hide`. That is not a simplification: it is every operator the published definitions use.
 * SuperSaver needs only the first two; the loan adds the comparisons, every one of them against
 * a calculated amount deciding whether a loan is too large for the product it is on.
