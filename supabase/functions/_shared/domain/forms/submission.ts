 * `POST /api/forms/<id>`, so that the definition, the answers and the wire format can be put
 * side by side and read against each other.
 *
 * An ordered array rather than an object, because `FormData` permits repeated keys and the
 * real SuperSaver packet uses them: `input_1189[]` appears twice, once for the number and once
 * for the country. A JSON object would silently lose one of them.
