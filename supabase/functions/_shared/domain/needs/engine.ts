 * Evidence to confidence.
 *
 * Noisy-or: each signal independently fails to establish the need, and the need is established
 * if any of them succeeds. Several weak signals therefore add up without any one of them being
 * decisive, and nothing can exceed certainty however much evidence arrives.
 *
 * The alternatives both misbehave. A maximum ignores corroboration entirely — marriage plus
 * separate finances plus shared costs would score exactly the same as marriage alone. A sum
 * passes 1.0 on three soft signals and keeps going.
 *
 * Calibration: the design's worked example (§14) puts marriage, separate finances and shared
 * costs at about 0.85; this gives 0.87. Its other figures are illustrative rather than derived,
 * so they are not fitted to.
