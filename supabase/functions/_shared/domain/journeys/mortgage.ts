/**
 * §7.1 — the anchor journey. Primary and secondary applicant, the richest financial
 * requirements, documents, and post-submission state changes.
 *
 * Information gathered here is what every other journey then reuses.
 *
 * Sized for a demonstration (2026-10-05). It carried 41 applicable requirements, which cannot
 * be completed in front of an audience — and because every admin move starts from
 * `received_by_bank`, an application that can never be submitted means the bank can never move
 * it, so the whole second half of §67 was unreachable. What was cut is the form-filling that
 * carries no part of the story: occupation, employment start date, bonus, childcare, and three
 * of the five documents. What was kept is everything the bank already holds (free to satisfy,
 * and the point of §53), everything the affordability conversation turns on, and enough of the
 * second applicant to show one answer landing in several applications.
 *
 * The recordings still have not been translated, so this stays `draft` either way.
