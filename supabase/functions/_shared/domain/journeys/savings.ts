/**
 * §7 — a regular saver, opened on the way to something else.
 *
 * Short on purpose. A savings account is not a credit decision: there is no affordability to
 * assess and nothing to underwrite, so asking for the furniture of a mortgage application
 * would be theatre. What it does need is the target and the monthly amount, because those are
 * what make the plan — and the follow-up when the target is reached — possible at all.
