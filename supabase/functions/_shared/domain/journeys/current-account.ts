 * §7.2 — a current account in one name.
 *
 * The joint account was built first because it is the one that demonstrates invitation and
 * partner completion, which left somebody on their own being told the only current account on
 * offer was a joint one. That is a gap in the catalogue reading as a gap in the bank.
 *
 * Deliberately the shortest journey here. Opening a current account is the least that any of
 * these asks of somebody, and padding it out to look substantial would misrepresent it — there
 * is no income check and nothing to assess, because nothing is being lent.
